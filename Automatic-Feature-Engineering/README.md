# Automatic Feature Engineering with AutoGluon

This project demonstrates the power of AutoGluon's automatic feature engineering capabilities using the Spaceship Titanic dataset.

## Project Overview

The Spaceship Titanic dataset is a classification problem where we predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.

## Features

- Automatic feature engineering using AutoGluon
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## Dataset

The dataset includes passenger information such as:
- Age
- Home planet
- Cabin location
- Destination
- Spending on various amenities

## Requirements

- AutoGluon
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
